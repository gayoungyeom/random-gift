# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is the "random-gift" project. The codebase is currently empty and awaiting initial implementation.

## Development Commands

Commands will be added here once the project structure is established. Common patterns to expect:

- Build: `npm run build` or equivalent
- Test: `npm test` or `npm run test`
- Lint: `npm run lint`
- Dev server: `npm run dev` or `npm start`

## Architecture Notes

Architecture documentation will be added as the project structure is defined.

## Getting Started

This repository is currently empty. When beginning development:

1. Determine the project's technology stack (web app, CLI tool, library, etc.)
2. Initialize the appropriate project structure (package.json, build tools, etc.)
3. Update this CLAUDE.md with relevant architecture details and commands
4. Consider adding a README.md for project documentation
